## My experience of working on SDT on "Efficient, Trackable and Sustainable Workflow"  

It was **adventurous**. ðŸ”­ðŸ˜„

The planning or execution could have been better in the sense that, it could have been great if we already had prepared
the content a week before the conduct.  As a result of which, we could have been under less pressure and could have enjoyed 
the 5 days of course more. *But may be, this is how we learn.* ðŸ˜‰

The pressure itself made us learn at a much faster pase. Undoubtedly, being a non-IT or non-CSE faculty, learning 
these things have made me feel like **There is a magic in our fingers**. âœ¨âœ¨

As a result of which, I have become addicted to exploring GitHub for things and managing my documents like I always wanted to.
Learning together with a great [team](https://github.com/shailjasharma15) was an amazing experience. 

*Thank you* would be a small word to acknowledge you "[Dr Rai](https://github.com/hsrai)" for giving this great opportunity to learn and teach this powerful tool. 

With Regards
